## An Interpreter for the Monkey programming language

This simple interpeter project is based upon the excellent 'Writing an Interpreter in Go' by Thorsten Ball

### Lexer

The lexer takes in source code and converts each character into a token.

### Parser

The parser takes the tokenised code and creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
